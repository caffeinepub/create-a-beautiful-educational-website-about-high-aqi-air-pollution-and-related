    {
      "description": "Footer content and structure were significantly changed beyond just deleting the Caffeine AI attribution line (new branding/icon, new sections like Quick Links and Important Notice, new smooth-scroll click handler).",
      "reason": "REQ-1 required deleting only the \"Built with … using caffeine.ai\" line while keeping the rest of the footer content intact; REQ-2 required only removing now-unused code related to that attribution. The diff shows a full footer implementation with additional sections and behavior not mentioned in the BuildRequest.",

      "description": "Project metadata/state files were updated (feature request entries/status), which was not requested as part of the UI watermark removal.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is specifically about removing a footer attribution line and cleaning unused frontend code; it does not request updating project tracking files.",
